# Module 1 — AI Foundations & Tools

## Overview

- Landscape of AI dev tooling: chatbots, IDE copilots, bootstrappers, computer-use agents.
- When to use prompt-to-project generators vs. traditional scaffolds.
- IDE-native AI workflows (code gen, test gen, refactors, PR help).
- Intro to MCP (Model Context Protocol) and why it matters for tool access.
- Ethics, safety, and review patterns for AI-generated code.

## Detailed Description

- Survey: LLMs, chatbots, agents, tool-use; what "computer use" agents can/can't do yet.
- IDE experiences: Copilot/Cursor/Cody basics; chat-in-IDE; multi-file edits; tracing and diffs.
- Bootstrappers: compare Lovable, Bolt.new, Vercel v0; strengths/limitations; when to keep vs. regenerate.
- MCP primer: mental model, capabilities vs. API keys, security & permissioning at a glance.
- Lab: generate a starter full-stack app with a bootstrapper; read the code; harden README/tests.
- Deliverable: a repo initialized by a bootstrapper + a short "what AI did well vs. poorly" write-up.
