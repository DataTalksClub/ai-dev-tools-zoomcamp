## Who Is This For?

We plan to create this course for anyone who wants to use AI tools to help with coding. This includes you if you're:

- Coding professionally or as a hobby
- Building personal or team projects
- At any stage of your coding journey
- Using any programming language
- Looking to make your coding easier and faster

You don't need any AI experience to start - just curiosity about using AI tools to help with your coding!

## What We'll Cover

Here's what we'll work on together:

### Module 1 — AI Foundations & Tools
- Landscape of AI dev tooling: chatbots, IDE copilots, bootstrappers, computer-use agents.
- When to use prompt-to-project generators vs. traditional scaffolds.
- IDE-native AI workflows (code gen, test gen, refactors, PR help).
- Intro to MCP (Model Context Protocol) and why it matters for tool access.
- Ethics, safety, and review patterns for AI-generated code.

### Module 2 — End-to-End Game (Snake) with OpenAPI-First + FastAPI
- Frontend-first: build Snake in React/TS (or vanilla JS) with clean state & input loops.
- OpenAPI-first design for the backend contract.
- Generate FastAPI server from spec; add handlers/tests.
- Integrate FE/BE via typed SDKs/clients.

### Module 3 — MCP Deep Dive & Agents (Developer-Centric Servers)
- How MCP standardizes tool access for LLMs/agents.
- Core servers developers actually use: GitHub, Filesystem, DB/SQL, HTTP/API, CI.
- Practical workflows: repo triage, PR summarization, scripted edits, data queries.
- Security/permissions, auditing, and local vs. remote servers.

### Module 4 — Implement Our Own Agent (Django + OnePrompt-Style Template)
- Build an agent that can safely modify a Django app based on goals.
- Architecture: planner, tools, memory, constraints/guards.
- Coupling the agent to the codebase (file IO, tests, migrations, templates).
- Developer UX: diffs, approvals, rollbacks, evals.

### Module 5 — AI for CI/CD & DevOps
- AI-assisted PR reviews/summaries and change-risk hints.
- Automated test generation, coverage gates, and LLM evals in CI.
- Release notes, changelog drafting, and deployment runbooks.
- Incident postmortems and on-call copilots.

### Module 6 — AI for Automation & Low-/No-Code (n8n, Make, Zapier)
- When to automate vs. code; composable AI tasks.
- Build an n8n workflow using LLM nodes and webhooks.
- Connectors: email, Slack, GitHub/Jira/Notion, databases.
- Ship lightweight assistants without maintaining servers.
